The idia was the create a Web Application using established Tool to create a basic table editing functionlity.

The clean code pattern approach, would be over engineering for simple crude operation, without the need of business logic.

The Project uses Synchfusion as a library, and the new QuickGrid as an alternative.
For using Synchfusion appropiate licenencing might be necessary.

This project is intendet to help other people getting quick results for simple tasks.
